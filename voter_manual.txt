Voters can begin the voting process by running the following command: "cargo run"

If the election is closed, voters will not be able to proceed further, and the program will close. 
An election official will have to log in and open the election first. 

If the election is open, voters are presented with the voter check in. The program will ask for their name and date of birth 
and check what they input against the voter registration database. If their information does not match an entry in the database,
the program will close. If an entry is found in the database, the program will check if this voter has voted in this election before. 

If they have already voted, they will be informed, and the program will close. 

If they have not cast a ballot yet, then the candidates for each office on the ballot will be presented. The voter will enter 
the number for the candidate they are voting for in each office and press enter. After selecting a candidate for each office, 
the machine shows the voter their choices to confirm. If the voter selects “no” they can vote again and will redo the process.
